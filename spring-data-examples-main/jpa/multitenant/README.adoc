This is the parent project for a couple of examples demonstrating how to integrate Hibernates Multitenant feature with Spring Data JPA.

There are three modules for the three examples.

Each uses a different strategy to separate data by tenant:

1. Partition tables by tenant id.
2. Use a separate schema per tenant
3. Use a separate database per tenant.
